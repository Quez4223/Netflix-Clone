# Netflix-Clone

A project to build my skills and practice using React.js

Netflix clone is an app built using React.js, Firebase and using a third party API(TMDB). 

Some of the trailers on the app either do not work or show the wrong content. I used npm i youtube and npm i movie-trailer in the terminal to pull the content for the trailers but I need to research more on why it isn't working properly. 

The link to the launched app is here: https://netflix-clone-85e53.web.app/
